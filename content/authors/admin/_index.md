      In freeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design course, I have learned the fundamentals of HTML and CSS, including semantic elements, forms, and the box model. I did explore layout techniques like Flexbox and CSS Grid to build responsive, visually appealing designs. Finally, I applied these skills by creating projects like tribute pages, portfolios, and product landing pages, solidifying your understanding of responsive design principles.

  #   summary: |
  #     Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.
